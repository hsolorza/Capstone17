Our entire program is too big to upload onto GitHub,
so these files and scripts are the support code that have to be 
added to a project in Unity in order to work properly.
In order to quickly view what our code does,
in the "Video Demostration" folder of this folder,
video recordings have been added to demonstrate 
the functionalities of the provide code and our project overall.
