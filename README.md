# iCreate

  This is a virtual reality program designed to create generative designed architecture. iCreate was developed using Unity (https://unity3d.com/) for the HTC Vive with development support by SteamVR. The motion sensing software Leap Motion (https://www.leapmotion.com/) is used to capture hand movement which allows the user to forego controllers and use their hands to create shapes and designs.
